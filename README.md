# news-search-engine
In this project I implemented a news search engine that has access to a large collection of articles. The application offers the possibility for searching articles by different options. The programming language which I used is Java and I developed the project in Eclipse.

Each article has a title, an author, a publish date and, of course, its entire text body.

The engine supports the next functionalities:
•	Find articles published in a the last month
•	b. Find articles published by a certain author / set of authors
•	c. Find articles that have a certain word in their title
•	d. Implement a profile where users can save their queries

Data will be introduced from console.
